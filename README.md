LifeUpgrades
============

Update March 16, 2013

All code is for Life Upgrades.  Initial commits support the development of RoboTar. 

RoboTar is a robotic guitar assistant.  The software for RoboTar will allow users to enter or select chords and build and save songs from those chords.  There will be two initial versions of the RoboTar software.  One for PC and another for Android.

Initial commits to this repository will be for collaboration to complete the working prototype.

For all questions regarding the code on this repository, please send an email to Kevin Krumwiede at kleekru@yahoo.com.
